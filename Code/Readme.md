### Exploration Anaylsis for the Capstone Dataset

### Background

In this capstone project we attempt to build a predictive test models like those used by SwiftKey. This report contains the exploratory analsys of the dataset provided by coursera.

The data set contains 3 files in different languages (each resided in itâ€™s own directory), the following is the data files for US English: - en_US.blogs : collections of blogs, one line for each blog entries; - en_US.news : collections of internet news stories, one line for each news paragraphs; - en_US.twitter : collections of tweets from twitters;
